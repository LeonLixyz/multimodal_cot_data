  "output_text": "QUESTION:\nShow that for a right triangle, if \\(\\angle A = 30^\\circ\\), then \\(BC = \\frac{1}{2} AB\\).\n\n[problem_image_1]\n\nREASONING TRACE:\nTHOUGHT 0: We are given a right triangle \\(ABC\\) with \\(\\angle A = 30^\\circ\\) and the right angle at \\(C\\). We are to show that the length of side \\(BC\\) is half the length of the hypotenuse \\(AB\\).\nTHOUGHT 1: Let's analyze the triangle using geometric constructions. Draw the median from \\(B\\) to the midpoint \\(M\\) of \\(AC\\). This helps us explore the properties of the triangle and relationships between the sides.\n[reasoning_image_1]\nTHOUGHT 2: In the diagram, \\(M\\) is the midpoint of \\(AC\\), and the median \\(BM\\) is drawn. In triangle \\(ABC\\), since \\(\\angle A = 30^\\circ\\) and \\(\\angle C = 90^\\circ\\), it follows that \\(\\angle B = 60^\\circ\\).\nTHOUGHT 3: Since \\(M\\) is the midpoint of \\(AC\\), \\(AM = MC = \\frac{1}{2}AC\\). Now, consider triangle \\(BMC\\), which has angles \\(60^\\circ\\) at \\(B\\), \\(90^\\circ\\) at \\(C\\), and \\(30^\\circ\\) at \\(M\\).\nTHOUGHT 4: In a 30-60-90 triangle, the side opposite the \\(30^\\circ\\) angle is half the hypotenuse. Here, \\(BC\\) is opposite \\(30^\\circ\\) (at \\(A\\)), and \\(AB\\) is the hypotenuse. Therefore, \\(BC = \\frac{1}{2}AB\\).\nTHOUGHT 5: This geometric relationship confirms the required result.\n\nFINAL ANSWER:\nIf \\(\\angle A = 30^\\circ\\) in a right triangle \\(ABC\\), then \\(BC = \\frac{1}{2} AB\\).",
