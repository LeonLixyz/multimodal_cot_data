Draw the median $M C$. Since $M C$ is the median, $M C=$ $A M=M B$.
$30^{\circ}$
$A$

Triangle $A M C$ is an isosceles triangle with $\angle M A C=\angle M C A=30^{\circ}$.
Since $\angle B M C$ is the exterior angle of triangle $A M C$,

$$
\angle B M C=\angle M A C+\angle M C A=30^{\circ}+30^{\circ}=60^{\circ} .
$$


So, triangle $M B C$ is an equilateral triangle with $B C=$

$$
M C=M B
$$

$30^{\circ}$

That is $B C=\frac{1}{2} A B$.
