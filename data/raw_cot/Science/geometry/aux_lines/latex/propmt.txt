ok, lets do a different way, we want to directly save the trace in this format:

          "type": "text",

    },

        },

          "type": "text",
          "text": "THOUGHT 1: Let's identify all the forces acting on the book:\n- Weight ($F_g$): the force of gravity pulling down on the book\n- Normal force ($F_N$): the table pushing up on the book\n- Applied force ($F_{app}$): the horizontal force of 15.0 N pushing the book\n- Friction force ($F_f$): the force opposing the motion"

very simple as well. Since you already have the latex, you can easily do this.

For example, for this question:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\graphicspath{{../../latex/images/}}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\usepackage[version=4]{mhchem}

\section*{Problem}
In \(\triangle A B C\), in which \(A B=12, B C=18\), and \(A C=25\), a semicircle is drawn so that its diameter lies on \(A C\), and so that it is tangent to \(A B\) and \(B C\). If \(O\) is the center of the circle, find the measure of \(A O\).\\

\section*{Solution}
10.


Draw radii \(O D\) and \(O E\) to the points of contact of tangents \(A B\) and \(B C\), respectively. \(O D=O E\) (radii), and \(\angle B D O=\angle B E O=90^{\circ}\).

Since \(D B=B E\), right \(\triangle B D O \cong\) right \(\triangle B E O\), and \(\angle D B O=\angle E B O\).

In \(\triangle A B C, B O\) bisects \(\angle B\) so that \(\frac{A B}{A O}=\frac{B C}{O C}\).\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_04_17_97bc1f7e44d93c271a88g-160}

Let \(A O=x\); then \(\frac{12}{x}=\frac{18}{25-x}\) and \(x=10=A O\).

so basically put the question and image into separate places.
