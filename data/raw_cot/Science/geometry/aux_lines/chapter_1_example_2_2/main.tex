\maketitle

Show that the measure of the median on the hypotenuse of a right triangle is one-half the measure of the hypotenuse ( \(A M\) \(=M B=M C\) ).

Proof:
Extend \(C M\) to \(D\) such that \(C M=D M\).\\

Connect \(B D\) and \(A D\).\\
\(A B\) and \(C D\) are two diagonals and they bisect each other. So \(A C B D\) is a parallelogram.

Since \(\angle C=90^{\circ}, A C B D\) is a rectangle.\\

Thus \(D M=M C=A M=M B\).
