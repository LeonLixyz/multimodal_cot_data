They are in tools.py and will be imported for you.\nNotice that The upper left corner of the image is the origin (0, 0). Here are some code examples you can use to draw auxiliary lines on the geometry images provided in matplotlib format.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# this function takes a coordinate A, start and end points of a line BC, and returns the coordinates of the point E on BC such that AE is perpendicular to BC\ndef find_perpendicular_intersection(A, B, C):\n    # Convert coordinates to numpy arrays for easier computation\n    A = np.array(A)\n    B = np.array(B)\n    C = np.array(C)\n    \n    # Calculate the direction vector of line BC\n    BC = C - B\n    \n    # Compute the slope of BC if not vertical\n    if BC[0] != 0:\n        slope_BC = BC[1] / BC[0]\n        # Slope of the perpendicular line from A to BC\n        slope_perpendicular = -1 / slope_BC\n    else:\n        # If line BC is vertical, then perpendicular line is horizontal\n        slope_perpendicular = 0\n    \n    # Calculate the equation of the line passing through A and perpendicular to BC\n    # y - y_A = slope_perpendicular * (x - x_A)\n    # Rearrange to standard form Ax + By + C = 0\n    if BC[0] != 0:\n        A_coeff = -slope_perpendicular\n        B_coeff = 1\n        C_coeff = -A_coeff * A[0] - B_coeff * A[1]\n    else:\n        # If BC is vertical, AE must be horizontal\n        A_coeff = 1\n        B_coeff = 0\n        C_coeff = -A[0]\n    \n    # Equation of line BC: (y - y_B) = slope_BC * (x - x_B)\n    # Convert to Ax + By + C = 0 for line intersection calculation\n    if BC[0] != 0:\n        A_BC = -slope_BC\n        B_BC = 1\n        C_BC = -A_BC * B[0] - B_BC * B[1]\n    else:\n        # BC is vertical, so x = constant\n        A_BC = 1\n        B_BC = 0\n        C_BC = -B[0]\n    \n    # Solve the linear system of equations representing the two lines\n    # [A_coeff B_coeff] [x] = [-C_coeff]\n    # [A_BC    B_BC   ] [y]   [-C_BC  ]\n    matrix = np.array([[A_coeff, B_coeff], [A_BC, B_BC]])\n    constants = np.array([-C_coeff, -C_BC])\n    \n    # Use numpy to solve the linear system\n    intersection = np.linalg.solve(matrix, constants)\n    return intersection.tolist()\n\n\n# this function takes a coordinate A, start and end points of a line BC, and returns the coordinates of the point E on BC such that AE is parallel to BC\ndef find_parallel_intersection(A, B, C):\n    # Convert coordinates to numpy arrays for vector operations\n    A = np.array(A)\n    B = np.array(B)\n    C = np.array(C)\n    \n    # Calculate the direction vector of line BC\n    direction_BC = C - B\n    \n    # Since AE is parallel to BC, its direction vector is the same as BC\n    direction_AE = direction_BC\n    \n    # To find a reasonable \"point E\", you can just extend AE from A by some length.\n    # For visualization, let's extend by the length of BC\n    length_BC = np.linalg.norm(direction_BC)\n    \n    # Normalize the direction vector of AE\n    direction_AE_normalized = direction_AE / np.linalg.norm(direction_AE)\n    \n    # Point E can be found by moving from A in the direction of AE by the length of BC\n    E = A + direction_AE_normalized * length_BC\n    \n    return E.tolist()\n'''\n# GOAL #: Based on the above tools, I want you to reason about how to draw auxiliary lines on the geometry images provided in matplotlib format and solve the geometry problem.\n# Hint #:  When deciding what type of auxiliary line to draw, consider the following three options: \n(1) Perpendicular line: If you encounter MeasureOf(Angle()),60) or MeasureOf(Angle()),45), you can draw a perpendicular line. Use find_perpendicular_intersection(A, B, C) to find the coordinate of point E such that AE is perpendicular to BC. \n(2) Parallel line: Use find_parallel_intersection(A, B, C) to draw a line from point A parallel to line BC, which returns the coordinate of point E where AE is parallel to BC. Draw Parallel Lines: Parallel lines are always the same distance apart, which helps in geometry by giving equal lengths instantly. It is useful when finding perimeters of a shape. For example, if you draw a line parallel to one side of a shape, you automatically know the opposite side is the same length.\n(3) Connecting points in the circle: When there is a circle, connect the circle center to the point in the perimeter\n(4) One effective strategy involves using properties of circles, especially the tangent properties and the circle theorem (tangent segments from the same external point to a circle are equal). We can use the given lengths of segments and properties of the circle to form equations. However, for visual aid, drawing auxiliary lines that help visualize relationships or create right triangles might be helpful. Specifically, drawing radii to the points of tangency can aid in identifying and using these properties.\n\nThe jupyter notebook has already executed the following code to import the necessary packages:\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom IPython.display import display\nfrom tools import find_perpendicular_intersection, find_parallel_intersection\n```\n\n# REQUIREMENTS #:\n1.
