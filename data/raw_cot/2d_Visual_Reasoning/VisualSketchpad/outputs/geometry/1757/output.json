Use find_perpendicular_intersection(A, B, C) to find the coordinate of point E such that AE is perpendicular to BC. \n(2) Parallel line: Use find_parallel_intersection(A, B, C) to draw a line from point A parallel to line BC, which returns the coordinate of point E where AE is parallel to BC. Draw Parallel Lines: Parallel lines are always the same distance apart, which helps in geometry by giving equal lengths instantly. It is useful when finding perimeters of a shape. For example, if you draw a line parallel to one side of a shape, you automatically know the opposite side is the same length.\n(3) Connecting points in the circle: When there is a circle, connect the circle center to the point in the perimeter\n(4) One effective strategy involves using properties of circles, especially the tangent properties and the circle theorem (tangent segments from the same external point to a circle are equal). We can use the given lengths of segments and properties of the circle to form equations. However, for visual aid, drawing auxiliary lines that help visualize relationships or create right triangles might be helpful. Specifically, drawing radii to the points of tangency can aid in identifying and using these properties.\n\nThe jupyter notebook has already executed the following code to import the necessary packages:\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom IPython.display import display\nfrom tools import find_perpendicular_intersection, find_parallel_intersection\n```\n\n# REQUIREMENTS #:\n1.
