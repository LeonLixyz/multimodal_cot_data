Here are some tools that can help you. All are python codes. They are in tools.py and will be imported for you.
Notice that The upper left corner of the image is the origin (0, 0). Here are some code examples you can use to draw auxiliary lines on the geometry images provided in matplotlib format.

    # Calculate the equation of the line passing through A and perpendicular to BC

# GOAL #: Based on the above tools, I want you to reason about how to draw auxiliary lines on the geometry images provided in matplotlib format and solve the geometry problem.
# Hint #:  When deciding what type of auxiliary line to draw, consider the following three options: 
(1) Perpendicular line: If you encounter MeasureOf(Angle()),60) or MeasureOf(Angle()),45), you can draw a perpendicular line. Use find_perpendicular_intersection(A, B, C) to find the coordinate of point E such that AE is perpendicular to BC. 
(2) Parallel line: Use find_parallel_intersection(A, B, C) to draw a line from point A parallel to line BC, which returns the coordinate of point E where AE is parallel to BC. Draw Parallel Lines: Parallel lines are always the same distance apart, which helps in geometry by giving equal lengths instantly. It is useful when finding perimeters of a shape. For example, if you draw a line parallel to one side of a shape, you automatically know the opposite side is the same length.
(3) Connecting points in the circle: When there is a circle, connect the circle center to the point in the perimeter
(4) One effective strategy involves using properties of circles, especially the tangent properties and the circle theorem (tangent segments from the same external point to a circle are equal). We can use the given lengths of segments and properties of the circle to form equations. However, for visual aid, drawing auxiliary lines that help visualize relationships or create right triangles might be helpful. Specifically, drawing radii to the points of tangency can aid in identifying and using these properties.

The jupyter notebook has already executed the following code to import the necessary packages:
```python
from PIL import Image
from IPython.display import display
from tools import find_perpendicular_intersection, find_parallel_intersection

            you must draw auxiliary lines to solve the following question: Find x. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent.

# RESULT #:
THOUGHT 0: To solve for x, which is the length of line segment RT, we'll utilize the information provided about the geometric relationships, particularly those involving circles and tangencies. Given that U, S, W, and Q lie on the same circle centered at C with radius 6, and segments that appear tangent to this circle are tangent, we can use these properties to determine x.

You must draw auxiliary lines to solve the following question: [Find the area of the regular polygon. Round to the nearest tenth.]

-------------------

ASSISTANT:
THOUGHT 0: The given geometry consists of a triangle with vertices A, B, and C. The task is to find the area of a regular polygon, but the provided diagram and logic form only mention a triangle. To find the area of a triangle, we can use the formula: 

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

However, we need to determine the height of the triangle. Since we have the length of line AB, we can draw a perpendicular line from point C to line AB to find the height. This will help us calculate the area of the triangle.
