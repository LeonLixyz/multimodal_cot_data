You are an expert in creating clean multimodal chain of thought traces. Your task is to first analyze a raw reasoning trace along with associated images, and then generate a clean, structured, step-by-step multimodal reasoning trace that solves the original problem.

**Input Data Provided to You:**
The input data has the following components: A pdf file with a noisy or raw interleaved text and image reasoning trace. The problem might have image or not. The reasoning trace has image.

**Your Task:** Generate a *new*, clean JSON output trace that represents the *ideal* multimodal reasoning process to solve the problem, using the provided images only. In sum, your task is find a logical coherent text chain of thought interleaved with the imaged we provided to you.

**Output Format (Clean Trace with Placeholders):**
You MUST generate a valid JSON array adhering strictly to the following structure. Use the specified placeholders for images:
[
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "The original problem statement"
      },
      {
        "type": "image_url",
        "image_url": {
          "url": "[input_image]" // use this placeholder for the input image. If the problem does not have an input image, do not include this.
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "<Clear description of your thought in text>"
      },
      {
        "type": "image_url",
        "image_url": {
          "url": "[intermediate_image_1]" // use this placeholder for intermediate images.
        }
      },
      // ... Add more text thoughts and image placeholders (if presented in the input) as needed for logical flow ...
      {
        "type": "image_url",
        "image_url": {
          "url": "[intermediate_image_X]" // Placeholder for subsequent intermediate images
        }
      },
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "<Description of the final reasoning step before the answer>"
      },
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "ANSWER: <The final calculated answer based on the reasoning>"
      }
    ]
  }
]

**Key Guidelines for Generation:**

1. Generate Coherent Reasoning: Focus on creating a logically sound step-by-step thought process that correctly solves the problem, using the provided images and context trace for understanding.
2. Use Placeholders for Images: Represent **all** images in the generated JSON using placeholders: `[input_image]` for the initial problem image (if it has an initial image) and `[intermediate_image_X]` (e.g., `[intermediate_image_1]`, `[intermediate_image_2]`) for images generated during the reasoning process.
3. The problem might contain image or not. If the problem does not contain image, ignore `[input_image]`
4. Output the math equations in latex format.
